### Causal Effects of Education & Occupation on Income: An Instrumental Variables Approach

This project applies advanced econometric methods using R to estimate the true impact of education and occupation on income, while correcting for endogeneity bias. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS/IV) models are implemented, using settlement size as an instrumental variable. The analysis includes robustness checks, subgroup (gender) analysis, and income inequality metrics to support reliable, policy-relevant conclusions.

**Skills & Tools:**

* R (tidyverse, econometrics packages)
* OLS & Instrumental Variables (2SLS)
* Endogeneity testing (Hausman, RESET)
* Data visualization
* Inequality analysis

**Key Concepts:**
Instrumental variables, endogeneity, causal inference, policy analysis, robustness checks
